<elements>
	<black>
		%s energy seems to be something of a base for the others; to that end, it is best associated with magic itself.
	</black>
	<red>
		%s, when applied, gives protective and defensive capabilities.
	</red>
	<green>
		Energy of the %s type emanates from nature, from living things.
	</green>
	<brown>
		The earth, on the other hand, seems primarily composed of %s, which permeates the rock and ground.
	</brown>
	<blue>
		%s glows, banishing the darkness, so it must be the element of light.
	</blue>
	<purple>
		Rather than being a clear force of its own, %s is an interesting case; it seems more attuned to enhancing and boosting the power of the others than giving its own effects, but it is likely capable of transferring that enhancement to other things as well.
	</purple>
	<cyan>
		Not surprisingly, %s is fluid, and associated with liquids and fluid flow.
	</cyan>
	<lightgray>
		%s is similar visually to %s, so it is little wonder then that it is the element most seen associated with surprise and deception.
	</lightgray>
	<gray>
		The most neutral color of all, %s is unsurprisingly associated with flux, with change.
	</gray>
	<pink>
		Palpably hostile, %s is tangible from hostile mobs and similar sources, making it the element of strength and aggression.
	</pink>
	<lime>
		%s can be felt to move, to pulse, making it a clear candidate for energy associated with movement and mobility.
	</lime>
	<yellow>
		%s radiates power, so it is clearly the element of raw energy.
	</yellow>
	<lightblue>
		Creating all sorts of distortions around it, %s energy is clearly capable of manipulating time and its passage.
	</lightblue>
	<magenta>
		%s has the power to heal, making it likely to be the element associated with life itself.
	</magenta>
	<orange>
		Not very surprisingly, %s energy is warm, even hot, and is a core component of things like lava and fire.
	</orange>
	<white>
		%s ties together all the other colors, and unifies them into a coherent harmony, making it the purest of them all.
	</white>

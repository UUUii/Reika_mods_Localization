			Tangible Energy
		</title>
		<hint>
			Crystal energy is mostly an ethereal, intagible force. However, when concentrated, it may have a physical manifestation.
		</hint>
		<reveal>
			Sure enough, you have found places where crystal energy has coalesced and formed regular, glassy formations, ones that radiate the effects of their element.

			Fabrication
		</title>
		<hint>
			Surely the wooden crafting table is not sufficient to do all your crafting.
		</hint>
		<reveal>
			As expected, to perform feats more complex than making a wooden box to store your items, you needed to create a special more magically-sound table.
		</reveal>
		<desc>
			To create anything remotely magical, you needed a dedicated, magically-capable table on which to do it
		</desc>
	</casting>
	<dyetree>
		<title>
			Technicolor Trees
		</title>
		<hint>
			These trees seem to come in all sorts of colors; you wonder if there is something special about them.
		</hint>
		<reveal>
			Well, they seem to drop berries and dyes of their color, so that has to count for something...
		</reveal>
		<desc>
			Trees, likely magical, of every color, and which drop not only saplings but dyes and berries
		</desc>
	</dyetree>
	<multiblock>
		<title>
			More Complex Crafting
		</title>
		<hint>

		<desc>
			Using item stands has allowed you to expand the complexity of your crafting recipes

		</title>
		<hint>
			You may not be able to harness the power of the pylons yet, but these may make a milder alternative, allowing you to enhance your crafting capabilities.

			Liquid Effects
		</title>
		<hint>
			Liquid chroma has already proven itself a solvent for items tossed in. What else might happen?
		</hint>
		<reveal>
